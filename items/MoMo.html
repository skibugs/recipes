    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Momo is a popular Tibetan and Nepali dumpling made with a thin flour dough filled with a mixture of minced meat or vegetables, garlic, ginger, onions, and spices. The dough is rolled into small circles, stuffed with the filling, and then folded into a pleated shape. These dumplings are steamed, fried, or boiled until fully cooked. They are typically served with spicy tomato chutney or sesame dipping sauce. Momos are a delicious and comforting snack enjoyed across South Asia.
